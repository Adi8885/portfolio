        "### What is function calling in Gemini?\n",
        "The Vertex AI Gemini API is a family of generative AI models developed by Google DeepMind that is designed for multimodal use cases. Function calling is a feature of Gemini models that makes it easier for developers to get structured data outputs from generative models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Developers can then use these outputs to call other APIs and return the relevant response data to the model. In other words, function calling helps you connect your generative models to external systems so that the generated content includes the most up-to-date and accurate information.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How function calling works\n",
        "Functions are described using function declarations, which helps the generative model understand the purpose and parameters within a function. After you pass function declarations in a query to a generative model, the model returns a structured object that includes the names of relevant functions and their arguments based on the user's query. Note that with function calling, the model doesn't actually call the function. Instead, you can use the returned function and parameters to call the function in any language, library, or framework that you'd like!\n",
        "\n",
        "### What you'll build\n",
        "In this codelab, you'll build a generative AI pipeline with the Vertex AI Gemini API and Python. Using your app, users can ask about exchange rates, and the system will fetch the latest data from an external API and respond to the user with the answer.\n",
